1. Goal

The goal of this program is :
  ~ Provided any number of files, print the last ten lines of the files(in the order specified, if a file cannot be open or read stop the process immediately).
  ~ Provided no files, copy standard input to standard output

2. Assumptions
I assume that newlines are represented by \n. So, this program will only hold up to *nix standards, and the number of lines in the program should be equal to
the amount of newlines in the program. However, I have to account for the fact that the last line might not end in \n.

3. Design
  The approach I'm going to take is to read the file, then iterate it over backwards, taking note of how many newlines exist. The last character will not be 
checked, but will always be counted towards the count of newlines.
