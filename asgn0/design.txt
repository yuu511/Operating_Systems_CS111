1. Goal

The goal of this program is :
  ~ Provided any number of files, print the last ten lines of the files(in the order specified, if a file cannot be open or read stop the process immediately).
  ~ Provided no files, copy standard input to standard output

2. Assumptions
I assume that newlines are represented by \n. So, this program will only hold up to POSIX standards, and the number of lines in the program should be equal to
the amount of newlines in the program, the character buffer size will be [4096], and will only be guaranteed to work on *nix systems.
However, I have to account for the fact that the last line might not end in \n.

3. Design
  The approach I'm going to take is to read the file, then iterate it over backwards, taking note of how many lines gave been processed from the amount of \n characters counted. 
The first character that is not empty (which will be the last character of the original document, as we are iterating backwards) will not be checked, and will be counted as a 
line whether or not it ends in \n, as explained in the assumption above. The iteration will end once this number is greater the amount of lines to print specified, which is 10. Since 
we are iterating the text line backwards, we are writing from the end to the beginning in the buffer we are writing to , as to preserve the original order of the text (it would be
backwards if we wrote normally from beginning to end) .
